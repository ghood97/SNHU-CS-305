Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized plans for their customers and they want to modernize their operations processes. Artermis financial already has a RESTful web API and they want us to do a security audit on their app in order to protect it from external security threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did a very good job at documenting all security vulnerabilities and their possible mitigation plans. COding securely is a very important task because it ensures that there is no unauthorized access into a companies resources or sensitive data. Software security add great value to a company's overall wellbeing. By mitigating risk of security breaches, companies will retain more customers and will increase the truse of thier clients.

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment for me was getting used to the Java environment. I am used to working with other languages so there was a bit of a learning curve when it came time to build the application.

I increased the layers of security in the application by encrypting data using the SHA-256 algorithm. In the future, I would probably use the same or a similar dependency check like OWASP. I like that it produces a report for you in HTML format.

After refactoring the code, I ensured that it was still secure by re-running the dependency check to be sure that I didn't introduce new vulnerabilities into the code base. I also made sure to test the endpoints to make sure all of the code still functioned as intended.

I think the vulnerability diagram that we used throughout the course is a resorce that I would use in future tasks. Even later in my career when I am writing code at work I may still refer back to this diagram.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show future employers my implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm and how it was used to hash and encrypt data.
